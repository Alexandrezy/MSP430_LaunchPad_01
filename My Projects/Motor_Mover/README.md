# Button Controlled Stepper Motor

This schematic is based on the desire to put the chip directly onto a breadboard
so I have incorporated a reset button. If you want to use the LaunchPad ignore the stuff 
coming out of the RST pin.

using Code Composer Studio (CCS) Version: 6.0.1.00040 on Windows 7. CCS is free and fully supports 
all the M430G2553 functionality.
